This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to track your medicine intake.

Last year I had to take some routine medicines but I often used to forget whether I had or not that day. So I created this simple tracker to track when and which medicine I took. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I no longer need this so this repo is no longer maintained.
